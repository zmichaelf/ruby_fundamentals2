# Googling to see what I could find on even/odd:
# % is the modulo operator. The result of counter % 2 is the remainder of counter / 2.
# n % 2 is often a good way of determining if a number n is even or odd. If n % 2 == 0, the number is even (because no remainder means that the number is evenly divisible by 2); if n % 2 == 1, the number is odd.
